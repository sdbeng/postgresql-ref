# Joins
Inner joins between two tables returns rows of data that exist across all joined tables, excluding rows that may only exist in one of the tables but not the other table.

Outer joins return every row that exists in the left (in a left outer join) or right (in a right outer join) joined table, while rendering NULL values on rows whose foreign key does not match a record in the other (right or left) table.

The "left" table refers to the table to the left of the JOIN statement in the query, whereas the "right" table refers to the table to the right of the JOIN statement in the query.
